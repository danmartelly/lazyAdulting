        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>
            An emergency fund is meant to prevent you from unlucky breaks and the kind of debt that could give you a bad time for months.
            Let's look at an emergency situation and the 3 possible outcomes that could arise.
            <b>Situation</b>:
            Your car, which you depend on for work, needs a new transmission which will probably cost <a href="https://carservicecosts.com/transmission-repair-cost/">$1,500</a>.

            <b>Option A lose your job</b>: You can't get to work which means you lose your job.

            <b>Option B Wait until you have enough money to fix the problem</b>: For example, you could carpool with a friend or take public transit.
            Save up some money for the repair while you use these cheaper options.
            However, if your job requires driving around to meet customers in your own car, you might need to consider one of the options below.

            <b>Option C Pay for the repair on your credit card</b>: With a credit card, you'll be able to pay back the debt you incurred
            over a period of time. But, if you're not able to pay it off quickly, that means you'll be paying a lot in interest;
            potentially <a href="https://www.citizensbank.com/learning/cost-to-use-your-credit-card.aspx">hundreds of dollars</a> on top of the original cost.

            <b>Option D Pay for the repair out of your emergency fund</b>: This repair classifies as an emergency since you need
            it to work! Go ahead and pay for it out of your emergency fund and go back to work. Save up money back into your emergency
            fund over the coming months until it's back at its original value.

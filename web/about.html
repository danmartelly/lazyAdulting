            Navigating the adult world can be hard. I've had the good fortune to have room to make mistakes
            because of a good education, a good job, and having my parents as a security net.
            But, I know not everyone has the time, energy, or resources to make the same mistakes, so the idea with
            this website is to give simple instructions for how to be a responsible adult.
